# Data Integration and Analysis Project 📊

This project involved managing data from various sources like PostgreSQL, Excel, and CSV files. The primary goal was to efficiently handle and analyze this diverse data, utilizing tools like Talend, Cloudera and Power BI.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- **Talend**: Used for creating data integration jobs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from PostgreSQL, Excel, and CSV files.
- **Cloudera**: Employed Cloudera Manager to manage and process data within Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization, exporting data, and generating customized graphs and statistics.

## Workflow 🔄

1. **Data Extraction**: Utilized Talend jobs to extract relevant information from PostgreSQL, Excel, and CSV files.
2. **Transformation**: Implemented necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Loading to HDFS**: Loaded transformed data into HDFS within Cloudera Manager, generating text files.
4. **Data Lake Creation**: Stored generated files in a data lake, facilitating the creation of a NoSQL database.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented partitions and buckets for each table to optimize performance and reduce query response times.
6. **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Power BI to present data in visually appealing and informative graphs and statistics.

## Key Features 🚀

- Efficient data handling from PostgreSQL, Excel, and CSV files.
